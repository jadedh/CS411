4) Architecture and framework:
Primary:
Based on our analysis, we are going to use a 2 tier architecture running a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache/Nginx, MySQL, Python). We chose this setup because our app is not going to require a lot of processing power on the back end since we are mostly gluing together APIs. We will use Django as a web framework for its out of the box feature set and plugin support. The database will run on the web server because we will be storing minimal information there with infrequent calls (user settings, preferences, registered users). Our group members also have experience with SQL and Python.

Alternative:
Node.js would be our second choice for the framework, but because our website do not require very complex algorithm on the back end it is not necessary for us to use Node as our platform. Also, we do not have members who is proficient with the framework so we would need to plan head to have time to learn the technology.
